# Overview

This was an attempt to familiarize myself with the Kotlin language. I wanted to make something fun to get to know the language better and to have a game to play whenever I wanted.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Add a turn system for a second player.

- Add a function to loop the game until a certain criteria is met and then give the option to start again
